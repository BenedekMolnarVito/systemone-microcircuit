# PROGRESS — Phase 3: implement SPEC (started 2026-10-18)
Phase 1+2 done (SPEC v1.3, README, jev-browser skill). Phase 3 plan: TASKS.md "Phase 3" table, waves W1–W9 from SPEC §8.3.
## Now
- Done+committed: T01, T02, T10, T03, T06, T13. Running: T12, T04 (opus), T07. T11 done.
## Next
- W2: T02, T06, T10 parallel (same tree; files disjoint; children don't git).
## Protocol
- Children: owned files only + reports/<id>.md, no git. Controller: run unit tests, commit per task by path, update TASKS/PROGRESS.
## Blockers
- none
## Decisions
- No worktrees: file sets disjoint per wave, controller sole committer.
